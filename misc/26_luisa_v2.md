## Agenda
00:00:00 Luisa begins demo 
 
## Event
Did you know that there are many astronomy data archives, all publicly available? Or, did you have a cloudy night but still want to do some astronomy? Do you really want to see the sky tonight but you also like running water and A/C? There is a ton of research-quality astronomy data available to you *right now*. You just need to know how to get access to it! In order to understand how astronomical images work, you need to know about what color images really are, so I'll spend time on that. I'll cover a few of the many ways that you can get access to real data, from citizen science web-based projects to FITS files. I’ll cover a few basics of how to interpret astronomy images, and demonstrate how to get access to NASA’s Infrared Science Archive (IRSA).

## About the Speaker
Dr. Luisa Rebull is a research astronomer at the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) at Caltech. She has always wanted to be an astronomer, ever since she was very little. She got her undergraduate degree in physics from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, and her graduate degrees in astronomy and astrophysics from the University of Chicago. She has been on the science staff at IPAC since 2002. Her research focuses on the formation of young, low-mass stars all over our Galaxy (stars ~1 to 50 million years old) and in understanding how stellar rotation changes over the first billion years of a star's life.
