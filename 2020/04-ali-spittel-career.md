# Ali Spittel:  Navigating Your Tech Career

## Video  https://youtu.be/1X5h0FRqKVs


all right it's 7:05 so I'll do my intra
bit and we can happen to yours
hey everyone my name is ty I will be
doing an intro quick and true and then
Ali will be giving her presentation if
you have questions there's a QA function
and zoom so you can ask the quench
questions there if I can answer it I'll
help answer if not we will run through
them at the end okay so I'm just gonna
give a quick introduction then I will
talk and then we'll do QA this will be
recorded so if something happens you
have to leave or someone you know wasn't
able to attend the recording will
automatically be sent out by General
Assembly usually I think it's within a
day but it might be two days so just an
intro on how a she teaches people how to
code she loves Python JavaScript and
talking about code and she's always been
interested in programming art and
education she's on the distinguished
faculty at general assembly and then she
runs courses there so her home page is a
little she got a pretty cool domain name
there what does tell is that what like
region is that and then our Twitter as
well and then we're throwing the event
with data umbrella so data umbrella is a
meetup group that provides welcoming and
educational spaces for underrepresented
groups in the fields of data science and
machine learning so you can check them
out at dat umbrella org and on Twitter
at dat umbrella and then our lovely
co-hosts PI ladies in New York City so
it's a group for Python ladies and nine
binary people of all levels of
programming experience and we're
throwing the event with the New York C
chapter but they are a global
organization so you can check them out
at PI ladies calm or at NYC PI ladies
and of course general assembly the glue
that brings everyone together GLAAD
General Assembly is a global pioneer in
the education and career transformation
space
I work there as a product manager and
Ally works there as a instructor and
that's how we met and so I will let Ally
get to her presentation awesome let me
get into Oh No what just happened
okay no let me share my screen okay
y'all seeing my slides yep okay awesome
I get to do this all day every day
teaching via zoom now and always have to
ask whether I'm sharing the correct
screen because they've always changed
their interface it's amazing so I am
going to talk about the career advice
that I wish that I had if you are big on
social media or whatever
I am a spittle on all of them so you can
find me there um I have learned a lot
from my many many many career mistakes
and I want to share those with you today
so that you can avoid leaking those same
mistakes that I did and also hopefully
just learned some advice as well I do
want to say before it I start that I
know that I am in a position of
privilege as a professional developer
and a white woman who is college
educated and mid-career so I'm coming
from that perspective and I know that I
cannot represent all different career
experiences in this one talk so want to
put that up front that being said I want
to talk a little bit about my background
just as free me here so I did not know
what coding was until I was a sophomore
in college I took a computer science
class thinking that I was going to learn
how to format Microsoft Word documents I
thought that's what computer science was
and so instead I fell into this magical
world of typing something into a
computer in Python and getting something
else
out
and that being said I started to take
more computer science classes thinking I
was going to do that as my major or
minor or something along those lines and
then a little bit later I had really
imposter that had impostor syndrome and
I quit I thought that I just wasn't good
at programming I thought it wasn't for
me I thought I found out about it too
late and so I left and so two classes
into computer science in college and I
quit programming I accidentally became a
software engineer though the next year I
learned that I could automate a lot of
my own job using Python and so I'm glad
he's knocking to Python people tonight
because Python is where I started my
career and
again it felt magical for a second time
I was able to do a lot of the automated
or the things that I was doing manually
in an automated way so as opposed to
accidental so two potential ways to
learn to code I have been through both
of them both in dropping out of CS and
then also in self teaching most of code
especially web development and then the
third way is through a boot camp for
most people and so I've been teaching at
GA
for the last three years in all sorts of
roles there so can definitely speak to
that as well and have taught hundreds of
students to do that um I have made so
many mistakes as this slide says I've
trusted the wrong people stayed in toxic
environments taking the wrong job then
way underpaid and under titled and his
points in my career as well but I've
also done some things right which is
probably why I'm talking to you right
now and I've been so lucky to have grown
a pretty significant online following
and just for context because I think if
this is relevant to the discussion that
I've been able to build up a blog that
gets up to like three hundred thousand
reads a month and my social media
following is pretty sizable and so I'm
coming from that perspective in this
talk and talking about how those career
moves have really benefited me and how
hopefully some things that can be
actionable for you I will also be
looking at this Q&A so feel free to stop
me at any time um I'm pretty comfortable
with the talking teaching interruptions
thing just because again I do teach all
day so can definitely answer those okay
so the first part of this talk I want to
talk about the search itself so
searching for a job and what that looks
like
my first thing that I would say is to
find your niche find your sub industry
with intact that you want to work in and
so for my students I talked about
front-end development back-end
development you could be a full-stack
developer you could be in a UX to
engineer so if you really
just like html/css more than you like
javascript that could be a awesome path
for you as well
data science engineering management QA
engineer there's so many different paths
out there and if you are somebody who is
a people person there is a space for you
within tech that was something that
terrified me before going into tech I
thought is a buncha introverts it's not
there's a place there as well for you
with engineering management or with
teaching which is also a career path or
even just being a developer being able
to interact with people is huge there as
well so first find what you're
passionate about what fires you up what
makes him say because if it's something
that you're excited about you're going
to be so much more likely to want to put
time into it and put work into it and
it's gonna keep you motivated also to
the job search prioritize your values
success looks wildly different to
everyone this is a conversation I had
with some friends recently that success
to all of us look very different and
success to us personally looks very
different than what we projected on to
other people so for me success is
feeling stable and that I don't have to
worry about my basic needs and feeling
fulfilled and feeling like I'm making a
difference in people's lives which is
what I prioritize where is somebody else
they may prioritize money more or they
may prioritize work-life balance more
and right now at the position of a man
in life is work-life balance isn't my
top priority but for something next to
me it could be and so have those values
and prioritize them they are totally
valid even if they are different than
somebody else's I would even recommend
writing these down and
I'm thinking about them at every phase
of the search so the interview is make
sure that you're asking the questions
there that you're going to find out if
those things that you prioritize are
going to be prioritized by the company
when you're negotiating you can
negotiate for more than salary - I used
to send ago sheet working seven to three
and said and nine to five you can
definitely negotiate for the things that
you prioritize so along those same lines
write down your goals and your
non-negotiables what are the things that
are hard limits for you that you for
sure are not going to accept in a job do
you need a certain salary do you need a
certain amount of work-life balance
superstructure hours a certain title
what hours the day do you work best what
type of team do you work best on do you
like big teams II like tight-knit teams
do you like working remote if you like
working in person all these questions
are so important and some of them are
going to be more important for people
than others
so definitely write them down so that
you can revisit them and have them there
as a reference
even when a job sounds awesome you can
still revisit that like oh okay even
though it sounds really awesome it might
not be a great fit for me for X and my
reasons online applications can suck I
have done hiring for a couple different
companies as an engineer and it can be a
total black hole to apply online because
there are hundreds of people filling out
applications for one slot and so getting
through that process is really really
really difficult it is so much easier to
get through that process if you know
somebody so you all are doing a huge
thing by just showing up tonight and
showing up to meetups in general it's
going to allow you to make those
interpersonal connections so that
instead of applying font blindly and
doing the one-click applications or
whatever you're actually putting a name
to a face um and there's alternative
ways to do things - I got my first job
in tech by cold emailing a company and
being like your interests and mine
aligned I know Python
I also am interested in what you're
doing will you hire me on as an intern
that's how I got my first job in tech
and so um there are so many ways of
getting jobs it's not just limited to
those online applications they're really
difficult to navigate through portfolio
sites are hugely important if you have
time to make one even if you do it via
something like square sleeves where it's
just a couple clicks or even something
simpler than square face they a squared
face almost intimidates me but just have
some sort of landing page that links to
all the information about you and your
information and the really nice thing
about portfolio sites is that they can
show everything about you in the way
that you want it to be showed so for me
I am less than I'm doing code side
projects right now I'm more big on doing
speaking and so that's what I prioritize
on my site what I feature so I'll show
you a couple of my favorite portfolio
sites first I'll show mine just because
it has to be one of my favorites so it's
something that I belts but it has my
about it has talks that I'm doing and
some of my rating and that's it
it's really minimal it didn't take very
long to the create at all just a couple
hours another one of my favorites is
from my old co-workers or Ben how burn
it's a wild portfolio site it is so
untraditional and it actually plays
music and blows up the browser because
it's so intensive on things on the speed
but it really shows Ben's personality
and it shows his interests and it's
hilarious
and he's really funny so this is another
portfolio site that I think is super
super cool um this one's are really out
there one way less simplistic than the
other ones um this one's a full-blown
game and you play the game to get
through all the information about them
which is pretty wild so that's a really
really impressive edge Keith's one this
is another more minimalist one for a
designer which I really like as well so
so many different way
to create a portfolio say you don't have
to go all in I don't think I'm gonna get
asked a lot about portfolio sites is if
you are less of a front-end person so
your work is less visual and my
recommendation for that would be to have
case studies or descriptions of what
you've built so imagine it's less visual
you can still display it on a portfolio
another thing that I really liked that's
become more of a trend is having a
searching page or a hiring me page so
this is a Lea plan to use site and on
here she has a guide to what she's
looking for in a company so like she
values diversity and work-life balance
and the ability to have a vacation and
that you're not an agency or whatever
and then when she's available where she
wants to live and about her and I
thought that this was really awesome
because it has exactly what she's
prioritizing she is making the search
come to her instead of the other way
around so I found this really inspiring
it's not something that I've ever
personally done but if I were to do a
full-blown job search I would probably
do something like that thought it was
really cool so that's the first part of
the conversation is when you're
searching for jobs in the first place
and then the next piece of the process
is once you've found some places that
you're interested in is interviewing
first off want to say that toxic
interviews which is definitely a thing
in this industry make a signal that the
company itself is toxic too if they have
an interview process that
makes them look bad trust that if you
feel weird during that interview process
you probably do not want to work for
that company and I can tell you so many
horror stories I'm jumping through a
million hoops or being told by the
employee interviewing me that they
didn't really like working at the
company and they just do it for the
status and then jumping through multiple
rounds of whiteboarding or having to
write code in a Google Doc yeah not
ideal and those are flags and maybe say
that maybe this company is not something
that I am the most interested in working
at also if they forget to email you back
or they're really sloppy you're be
scheduling things all the time that may
mean that they're a little bit
inefficient or disorganized another
piece of advice is if you get asked a
technical question that you don't know
the answer to spin that answer so if you
are asked do you know react or you know
x and y about react or Python or
anything like that what you can say
instead of oh I don't know that instead
show your growth mindset say I don't
know react yet but I do know you and I
know that both use similar component
architecture and I also love learning
new things so I'd love to learn that on
the job so it meant that you don't know
it because it's easy enough to check in
like by asking more detailed questions
if you really do know that language or
not but we can also always spin it to be
a positive and show a growth mindset
with questions that you don't know the
answer to
so if you get asked technical questions
show how you think so show your process
maybe draw diagrams or pseudocode
intermediate code explain pitfalls in
that code you can definitely be vocal
and ask clarifying questions as well
because your that's part of being a
developer that's a part of being in tech
and so displaying your knowledge is
really important
another piece is always always always
always always negotiate and you can
negotiate anything so we mostly hear
about salary negotiations which is so
important especially as underrepresented
folks and tech negotiating so important
to get that up but also if there's less
wiggle room of salary you can always
negotiate your role so maybe you can
negotiate that one day a week is
dedicated to learning or that you get to
write one day a week for the company
blog instead of doing development work
or you could make it so that you work
less hours or you can negotiate um
remote days working remote a couple days
a week which isn't super relevant right
now because all the days are remote but
down the road that'll be more relevant
again you can negotiate benefits and
then the classic which is compensation
um I follow the following format when I
negotiate so I thank them for the
initial offer and tell them that I am
excited about the initial offer I'm
excited about their company for X&Y
reasons if I'm considering it I need to
be excited about it in some way so I'm
gonna state those reasons right there
tell them what I wanted to go treat so I
would like more days remote or I would
like to be paid X&Y and then I like to
list my wins that lead to me getting
what I need get achieved for so I have
demonstrated X&Y at my time at this
company and then explained how I want to
help the company in the future so my
talent and X&Y will help you with the
other things um seeing a couple
questions in the chat and first off I
will totally send out these slides after
I'll send them to a tie and you can send
them out to you all I can also tweet
them out if that is easier the other
question that I'm seeing is how to get
negotiate when the offer exceeds your
expectations is at least try shoot a
little bit higher see if they can wiggle
but you could also negotiate for
something different than compensation -
so dig ease off or remote time or bonus
or something along those lines but
always negotiate get that number up if
they're giving you an offer that's
higher than your you expect that means
that you are under valuing yourself in
the first place so that would be my
advice there
another piece of advice is to never ever
ever tell prospective employers how much
you make right now in addition it's
illegal in a lot of places I'm not sure
about New York specifically but in a lot
of places it is illegal to ask how much
you make within an interview if you do
get asked this question
spin it tell them a range of what you're
looking to make in your next position
but it's usually good to not put a
number out first ask them instead what
range they are looking to spend for that
position so never ever ever ever ever
tell anybody what you make right now
that will lead to you being in a lower
bargaining position when you're in
negotiations
and another piece of advice especially
for people in untraditional or from
untraditional backgrounds and types of
people who are just strategy waiting
from a bootcamp or self teaching is do
not under value your non-technical
so even if you are looking for your
first tech role that doesn't mean that
all of your experiences before this go
out the window
so if you did something in customer
service that will still help you work
with other people in tech it'll help you
deal with
um the difficult issues and complaints
from customers and all that that you'll
still have to deal with if you were a
teacher teaching code is super important
as well all of these things lead to you
being a better software engineer or
software developer or tech employee and
so do not under value them do not take
them off your resume do not take them
off your Linkedin and feel free to
include them in some interview questions
as well seeing some more questions so
how to negotiate a pay cut in the
current situation of business struggles
and should you that's a tough one um I
know that right now job situations are
so different than normal and so you may
have to take things that are less
desirable than normal definitely really
difficult um that's one that I haven't
had to deal with personally it's yet but
I don't know if anybody else has an
advice for that one I'm so sorry what
was the question again
about negotiating a pay cut in the
current situation who yeah that's tough
it's a really tough one I guess what's
the situation was someone like offered
it like the company told them they're
doing pay cuts and they try and
negotiate it up like less of a cut
that's a really good question yes more
contacts would help I mean my I mean it
this is a tough time like my I'm always
thankful every day that I actually still
have a job because I know a lot of
people have had to take 20 40 percent
cuts a lot of people are unemployed yeah
and I know two people were just
furloughed last weekend and they work in
tech so yeah it's it's a crazy time the
difficult time for sure and very out of
the norm so many things that do not
normally happen are happening right now
but I would not go for that unless it's
the absolute worst-case scenario another
question about what red flags to watch
out for the during the actual interview
I would say if they have rounds and
rounds and rounds and rounds and rounds
of interviews that feel like they're
asking you the same things that to me
would be a red flag that they don't
value my time in fact I try to ask as
many of the questions that I am looking
to have answered during the phone screen
so that I don't need to take time away
from my current job in order to
interview that would look different if
you are looking for your first job in
tech though I would say at that point to
take as many interviews as possible so
that you have practice interviewing um
and then other red flags to look out for
is disorganized process then displaying
any toxicity during those interviews so
if anybody makes any disgusting comments
or anything like that during the
interview that's like a huge red flag
probably don't need to explain that
though um them asking questions that are
legal
all those types of things are red flags
I would also say that them asking
nitpicky weird overly technical
questions that rely on rote memorization
that for me is another red flag that
they are not trusting my experience or
that they want me to have things
memorized that don't really need to be
memorized so those would be red flags
that I would look out for when I am
interviewing and then also a question
about how I got my first internship and
how it looked
helped me when looking for my first tech
job so yeah I got my internship just by
reaching out to different companies and
cold emailing them honestly I would go
on to their website and be like you look
interesting to me my background lines up
will you hire me and I would find their
CEOs or whatever or partners and
especially at startups and I would reach
out to them just cold and send them
messages which was definitely
untraditional and probably is not the
best way to go about things but I think
it does say to network and use the
people around you so if that's going to
meet ups and trying to meet people there
or if it means
ah
using LinkedIn I've seen so many
students be really really successful on
LinkedIn by sending people messages and
responding to the people there
what was your most bones rate vehicles
emails so it was actually one one
because I only did it for that one
company and they hired me like that same
day which was absolutely it kind of
should have been Fred flag probably in
retrospect but I ended up working for
there for like two and a half years um
but I would have kept doing it I think
even if it didn't work out for that one
but it was the first company that I that
I did it for and then they were like
come in tomorrow for an interview and
then they hired me and I worked there
for two and half years but um yeah I do
not think that's traditional by any
means I I see my students see getting
jobs mostly through LinkedIn and
networking and then also through
connections that they had from previous
positions as well because those
connections don't go away how often does
an engineer need to learn new
technologies produce side projects using
new technologies in order to help
future-proof their career that's a
really good question but there are so
many jobs out there using legacy tech
like wasn't there something with the
unemployment system where they're
looking for for trend developers so I
would say that even legacy tech is
pretty important and that you should be
able to
leverage your experience with older
technologies to newer ones as well
because even though things change they
don't change that much and so even
though I'm not writing Python 2 anymore
like Python 3 is pretty similar so you
can for write your skills there I would
say that if you have time during your
work day to play with different things
that's a great thing to do but
all these things are connected and so I
wouldn't say that it's a necessity
especially when you do have a couple
rolls under your belt to keep building
those side projects I think that you
need to prioritize what's important to
you and so what that is building side
projects and learning new things and
that's totally valid but if you have
other things in your life that you're
prioritizing instead I would prioritize
that any text about handling
conversations without equity I would say
that it's not guaranteed that that's
going to work out and so if you really
really believe in the product then go
for it but don't take equity instead of
a salary I've seen that all the time
with people reaching out and Linkedin
like you won't get paid but you will
have equity once their company starts
making money do not do that under any
circumstances that's exploitation so
messed up but handling conversations
about equity you I have seen that
companies will give you an option of
either more equity with a slightly lower
salary or a higher salary with slightly
less equity I would say in that case
it's gonna depend on how long you see
yourself staying at the company and how
much you believe in their product I
would say that it is definitely
negotiable anything is negotiable and
the numbers are gonna look really really
small up front but if you do the math on
their growth that tiny percent is going
to grow over time there's different
amounts of equity depending on what
stage startup they are so a very early
precede or like a seed round startup is
going to be able to give you a lot more
equity but also gonna be a lot more
risky whereas somebody who's like a
seriously startup who has a bunch of
funding they can probably afford to pay
more but there they have a lot less
equity to give because they've already
given a lot of their equity away for the
most part
cool other questions
almost Oh SGA's data analytics Congrats
and long curve marketing business
development but no tech work most the
job postings require data analysis
experience but how can you think you can
sell your experience well I would say
that you are probably using similar
tools in your day-to-day now and you
have relevant experiences as a
professional and working in the field
and you can definitely leverage that
into your data analysis career um list
of technologies that you've learned for
sure but those skills definitely for a
for one to another but I also not a data
analyst or a marketer or a business
development person so I can speak a
little bit less to that if anybody else
has more experience and those would be
awesome to talk more about that in the
jet yeah one thing I would say with with
data analytics is if you're if you're
still working at a company and you're
just doing the data analytics course
part-time try to do a project at work
every company has data whether it's
called data CRM data web site visit data
try to work with someone on the team on
whatever analytics team and just try to
do a project cuz that's one of the few
projects you can actually do without
messing anything up like if you're some
if you're learning software developing a
website chances are your company's not
gonna be like oh yeah you can just redo
our website like um after taking like a
small course but data analytics you can
get a dump of a database or a CSV file
and just crunch some numbers without
affecting anything in the business so
that's what I think is the best with the
data analytics or data science course
and then that also says that you have
professional data analysis experience
Institute once you do that word project
so awesome do you want to go through the
rest of the slides and then do questions
or I don't know how many yeah I'll do
that I'll keep going through the slides
and then come back to the questions
simply that mm I'll come back to them
but I don't want to completely go off
track I feel like I am it could be just
a AMA that would be kind of fun too but
I will go through my slides okay so the
part three is code challenges which is
another fun part of this whole process
um I have a lot of experience with these
both on the grading set and on the other
side of doing them so first off you'd be
shocked at how many people do not read
the instructions
and turn in something different than was
asked for it so I would highly recommend
reading the instructions potentially at
multiple times and read the instructions
again before you turn in the project to
make sure that you did all the
requirements you will be better than 90%
of applicants if you just read the
instructions I am guaranteeing this um
another thing is if you are really
really interested in the rule go above
and beyond you don't need to spend all
your time on this by any means but
adding something simple that was not
asked for so in my subfield of software
engineering that could be adding tests
or adding some styling into something um
don't spend all your time on these don't
do unpaid work for companies but if you
have like an hour long code challenge
and you have 15 extra minutes to spend
on it do something above and beyond that
will really really stand out compared to
the other applicants this kind of goes
without saying but follow the best
practices for your language so if you're
using Python follow Pepe or add comments
add documentation things like that will
go a long way so that's a little bit
about code challenges and then pouring
into when you actually have the job and
things to do at work in order to further
your career so first something that I'm
really passionate about is keeping a
knowledge repository um I also want to
say that you do not have to do all of
this by any means these are just things
that I do that I find helpful so I want
to say them because they may be a little
bit different than you've heard before
but you do not need to do all of this by
natives do not feel like you need to so
I keep a knowledge repository full of
notes that I'm taking on things that I'm
learning um
shortcuts that I've learned I keep notes
on books that I've read as well so I
have this github repository it's
literally a repository that I could come
back to I'm also really interested in
other note-taking apps as well um github
for me is just so simple that I keep
everything on there but other amazing
tools out there to like notion were
like Rome research or something like
that that I've been seeing all the time
on social media recently and I just
applied for it I really want to see what
that's like but having some sort of
place where you write down what you're
learning because as a teacher something
that really really helps things stick is
you writing it down in your own words so
taking notes on things is great and if
you have them to come back to it'll help
you to solidify what you're learning
another huge one as somebody who was
battled impostor syndrome like no other
in this industry is trafficking wins so
for me I get student feedback all the
time from them about what's going well
or my teacher or whatever and I will
screenshot those and put them all in one
place so that if I'm having a bad day if
I'm having impostor syndrome I can come
back to those and see all those nice
messages and have my heart grow a little
bit um same thing with code winds
tracking my progress over time okay
remember how hard hello world used to be
well
now I've built this whole application
look at that growth and tracking those
sorts of wins is really awesome
also having notes about nice things but
coworkers have said about you nice
emails that you've gotten all those
sorts of things that you have them in
one place this also goes so far when
you're negotiating that you have all
these awesome things that you've done
all documented all right there for you
so that you can compile them when needed
I also have found especially when I'm
working on a company for a long time
that finding a new way to challenge
myself keeps it interesting so I learned
test-driven development on the job
because I wanted to challenge myself to
learn that finding ways to keep it
interesting even when you've been
somewhere for a while and maybe you're
day-to-day responsibilities have gotten
a little bit less interesting and sorry
for the tough language but don't
tolerate as somebody from an
underrepresented background in tech
there is going to be so much of that I
cannot tell you how much I've
waited through in my career you do not
have to tolerate it there's other things
out there you do not deserve that your
mental health does not deserve that
people are [ __ ] that's their fault
not yours so I want to remind you of
that somebody treating you poorly
especially because your demographics
that is in them problem not a you
problem it sucks it hurts and it is
awful but it's on them and it sucks for
you but it's their fault it's not yours
another thing that I spend we t real for
me especially recently is that burnout
is real there's a million things to
juggle and every time and don't let that
happen to yourself find a balance find
what works for you and if you're feeling
burnt out take that as a warning sign to
take some time off to take some time
away from work do something with that
you enjoy burning out is a very real
thing do not work all the time do not
work 24/7 um find some sort of balance I
do not have work email on my phone or on
my other computer I do not have work
slack on my phone or on my other
computer ty knows this from earlier
because I couldn't get on the zoom call
I keep it very very separate so that I
have some separation and some mental
time away from work helps me to be more
present with my students during the day
and then the last part is professional
development so get involved with the
community you are already a huge step in
that direction but the thing that
changed in my career the most of
anything was writing a blog post and 32
people read my first blog post I thought
that was a ton of people I thought that
was a huge deal that my blog was
happening and um people were help
getting help right
and it just grew over time and
progressively got bigger and bigger and
having that presence in the larger tech
community has made me feel more
connected to it I've been able to meet
more people like me especially early in
my career when there were absolutely no
woman on my team it's nice to be
involved in communities like one view
code and getting involved really changed
things for me and I know you always hear
that advice write a blog post or
something like that but even if it's
just for you writing those things down
publishing them somebody else will
benefit from them and teaching this
one's kind of personal to me but it
helps so much to understand things if
you have to explain it in a very
beginner friendly way and teaching what
you know can help raise your profile it
can help build a brand whatever that
means and it can get you more and more
connected to the community as well so
you do what you know speak I'd meet up
write a blog post tweet something
respond to something on it Developer
Forum there's so many different ways to
teach even if it's not something like
putting your job to become an instructor
or something like that there's little
tiny ways that you can teach or mentor a
junior developer at work I talked about
portfolios already um make friendships
in the industry when you're not looking
for a job this might not be the right
time for some of you but if you are
employed um I have gotten every
subsequent job in tech from friendships
that I've had previously so my second
job I was at GA and I got the job at GA
because I was guest left Jane because
one of my friends taught the data
science program and that's how I got the
position that I'm currently in I did
leave GA for a couple months to work for
another company in that one again was
working for a friend as well so some
friendships that are just for networking
are great but if you can have genuine
friendships where you're challenging
yourself and learning from each other
growing together when you're not job
searching that goes a long way as well
and can be really really useful for
getting references and things like that
down the road another thing that I like
to talk about for shaping your knowledge
when you're learning new things is
having a peachy
so T shape is having shallow knowledge
about a lot of different topics so
knowing what X&Y is knowing how to do a
hello world with X or Y but not
necessarily knowing it in depth just
knowing it enough to talk about it and
then having something that you're
specialized in and that's the bottom of
the team that's how I normally recommend
for people to just shoot their knowledge
too so what to specialize in so have
some sort of exploration into different
topics but then find something that you
really are knowledgeable and passionate
about okay so now I'll move back to the
questions if you have more they are in
there um keep in touch if you are
dropping off now I'm we learn code comm
in East little on all the socials and I
will switch back to questions so I'm a
former physics PhD grad who did a stint
in administrative work for a while I'm
looking to resign my current position
but put my full energy into pursuing
career
developer between networking self
teaching portfolio building what
activities would be most important to
focus on so I would say it to get
comfortable with your skill set and
start interviewing to see if your skill
set is in the rough ballpark of what
companies are looking for and once
you're confident with those skills build
out some projects to demonstrate those
skills so that employers can see what
you are creating and evil to create um
and then having a portfolio to
demonstrate those things I think is
great as well especially when you're
looking for your first job I think your
portfolio is the most important when you
are looking for that initial position so
that you can show that you've made
projects before in chalk and technical
skills in that capacity I would also say
that networking events are really
important so you're hitting on all the
really really important ones when you
can go to networking events try to do
like maybe one a week or something like
that so that you are making new
connections and fostering those they
don't have to be in person either I mean
they're all online right now but you
could also join a slack group I don't I
just moved to New York City like right
before current affairs hit so I don't
know too many slack herbs specific to
New York City but I know in DC where I
lived for a long time there was a woman
who coded on DC tech slack group and
those were really really awesome for
networking as well and you could just
drop in throughout the day and chat with
people there also social media on
Twitter is really big for developers and
LinkedIn also exists most the recruiters
are in there so that one's important to
cool as a woman in tech - ever faced
prejudice or microaggressions definitely
definitely I definitely have dealt with
a lot of wild things in my career
especially I got my first developer job
when I was like 19 years old and so
stuff at that point in my career was
really wild but even at industry events
and at conferences and things like that
now it's always tough to see an
experience even later in my career and
it's it's sad it's sad the industry
still in this place but it does make me
motivated to see events where there are
more women and my job at GA - it's
really awesome to see new developers
coming up who check into the industry
for the better I hope but it's
definitely still rough out there and if
you are dealing with something like that
you're not alone it's not just you it's
the way that the industry is
unfortunately and I don't think it's
just this industry either I think it's a
wider problem as well do you think it's
difficult to switch between data science
web development computer science and how
is it best to figure out which one you
like best
that's a really good question I started
off in a Python heavy more data science
just roll and then move more into web
development because I enjoyed the more
visual side of things and the kind of
creative interfaces all that I found it
fun um so I think it is definitely
possible because the coding fundamentals
are the same name from to get a science
to web development to computer science
the idea of a function in for loop is
the same across all three it's just that
the technologies do change so I would
say that it takes time and work in
making a portfolio and all that to show
off your skills but it definitely is
possible and it's easier to move from
one to the other rather than from zero
to one of them would be my advice there
then the next one I'm interested in a
very nice technical position that may
not have a much in the way of job
positions how does one look for network
and engage in that sphere building a
database operating system development
compilers reverse engineering etc
wow you are impressive that is super
cool things that I know nothing about it
especially compilers I mean I would
building a database that is so cool oh
my goodness I feel like just write a
blog post about a couple of those things
and I will 100% read all of them um
because that sounds like the most
impressive skill set I've ever heard um
I would say it's to try to find out
where the people in your sub field are
hanging out so who are the people
writing blog posts who are the people
hosting meetups if they exist and try to
network in those spheres but that one is
way out of my depth
I definitely not my world but I'm
incredibly impressed by it
yeah I know I'd like to add yeah maybe
check out Stack Overflow has like some
exchanges maybe check out like the
compile or exchange or those kind of
fields or check out subreddits about
them you can kind of talk and engage in
community and see what's going on I know
a couple people who've got jobs off just
like being active on reddit that's
interesting reddit might fit that skill
set pretty low brand new decoding and
starting a June SEI class with GA so
excited that is amazing I might have you
as a student what's your advice for me
starting my journey um okay so for SEI
students i should say to do your
homework and to do as much self teaching
beforehand as possible first so that you
know that you enjoy the subject and it's
something that you want to pursue but
secondly so that when you're seeing them
at the course you are seeing them for a
second time so the best way that people
learn from a technical perspective is
spaced repetition so
seeing the same topic multiple times
over a length of time and so if you have
seen these topics once on your own and
then you're taught it again a second
time in more detail with an instructor
in a different setting that information
is going to stick so much better in the
classroom if you have seen it before
then if it's the very first time that
you're seeing it so also your projects
will be super impressive as well so that
would be my initial advice but even
going to events like this as a huge leg
up and will really give you in the job
search process - any thoughts on
companies that ought to test candidates
on data structures and algorithms over
asking candidates to build something
especially for front-end roles for me I
really think that building things and
front-end specific questions they're so
much more relevant than the data
structures and algorithms things first
for me I feel like a lot of the data
structures and algorithms questions are
we doubts for people with untraditional
backgrounds so people who didn't have a
computer science degree it feels
sometimes to me like I'm cleaned out for
people who were self-taught or who went
through boot camps and boot camps do you
teach the data structures and algorithms
to an extent but it does worry me that
they're trying to be a little bit
keeping with those questions so I think
that it does obviously depend on the
question and the company but to me it'd
be something that would make me think
twice about what they are actually
asking that question for if I'm going to
use those things on the jobs and I think
it's totally valid to ask those
questions so if I'm going to be building
something that's super data structure
and algorithm heavy then yeah asking
those questions that's fine but if I'm
not gonna be building binary search
trees every day I'd rather be at
something about CSX would be Mike a
sense should I apply to a job post if I
feel like I will be a great fit but I
don't have enough experience or out the
requirements that they're looking for
how could I make companies notice me if
you're just starting your career okay
even if you do not fit all of the job
descriptions
apply
the requirements on job postings I think
are normally way more than they're
actually looking for they're just
putting things on there to have search
terms or something like that um usually
you do not have to meet all the
requirements that they are listing on
there whatsoever there's no harm in
trying unless they're asking you to jump
through a million hoops but I would say
to still try it especially if it is a
great fit something that looks like a
perfect fit for you um and then how to
make companies notice you know I think
having a portfolio that stands out and
networking goes so far because if
somebody can put a face to a name and
it's you're not just a resume and a
stack of resumes that is going to get
you way ahead especially if they have
hundreds of applicants so that would be
my advice there so you know many folks
doing data science for self-taught and
who have gone to a boot camp and don't
have degrees as soon as possible from
front-end web development jobs that I
hear less about it for other developer
jumps so GA does have a data science
program for boot camp and those grads do
awesome that's most of my experience
with data science from an untraditional
background somebody else can probably
answer that question better but
definitely I've seen a ton of GA data
science grads who have gone on to do
awesome things
yeah I think one thing with that
sometimes you might have to start at the
data analyst level and then work up to
the data science um but if there's
nothing wrong with that
you know sometimes not everyone can just
jump to that so that might be something
to keep in mind as well to take just
like a junior analyst level role and
then move up yeah and with anything with
being self-taught I think portfolios go
even further because they show your
different projects that you've built and
showing that skill is really important
another thing would be to try to do some
freelance gigs as well for anybody who's
self teaching because that's
professional experience on your resume
and having anything for a professional
basis goes a long way to I get brain
freeze when somebody asked to solve a
problem on the spot and write code for
it how to get over these nerves in the
interview oh I hear you it is so hard it
is not natural by any Miam staff to
write code under pressure so that is a
very normal experience to be afraid of
that or to be a little bit interest
during those situations in fact I feel
like it would be more abnormal not be
anxious in those types of situations I
would first think about what they're
asking I would write pseudocode first so
not actual code but write down in words
how you might solve that problem and
outline it and just write some rough
code down and then refactor it and make
it better down the road I think it's
also fine to acknowledge that you are
nervous that's something that I would do
is like it's kind of anxiety provoking
to be having to ask something like that
on the spot and it's also okay to admit
what you don't know so if it's not
something that you've seen before you
can talk about your approach and the
different things that you would do to
find that solution but that you know
that your example your answer is not
exactly correct and it's gonna have X&Y
bug I think showing your thought process
is the most important part of it anyways
if you have to go in a junior role how
long should you stay before thinking
about not finding another job that's a
really good question
I would say that it's totally valid to
look as soon as you're not happy in that
position anymore and trying to apply and
interview is perfectly valid as far as
time goes I would say that most people
stay in a junior position for like one
to two years would be my ballpark right
there but
totally valid to look faster than that
as well because usually jumps are gonna
happen from company to company instead
internally yeah I've never done this but
I know a friend that's a software
engineer and and someone gave him this
advice he said just apply for jobs every
year every 12 months just applied new
jobs even if you don't want to take it
just so you're always good at
interviewing he does that every year
he'll apply to like five or ten jobs and
just interview and if he gets a good
offer he likes it you'll go but
otherwise you'll just stay actually
really smart I interviewing and tech is
such a skill set in and of itself and so
having to strengthen that skill set I
think is a smart thing to do and I wish
that I had actually interviewed more
because I have barely interviewed and so
it scares me more now yeah I mean it's
like a skill say you use like once every
three to five years
um I think is there so we'll probably
wrap up if anyone has any more questions
you could just ask one or two more we
can do that oh oh that's just a question
yeah just go so far I've not even an
oversee that enough because you're
demonstrating your skill set in your
explaining things in clean English which
shows yours that you know your stuff so
well so blogging a plus yeah my thing
with with stuff like that like blogging
or or giving a talk is that of the
hundred people that wanna change jobs or
want to be a data scientist very few
people will do that right there's like
100 people that want to change in like
two or three of those hundred will
actually write blog posts or be active
so doing what very few people are doing
will help you stand out much more like
everyone is applying to jobs online
right like everyone's doing that so
you're not gonna differentiate yourself
but I guess a lot of people are blogging
now cuz they'll have more free time but
yeah if you can write something
interesting
for example a lot of the stuff I see on
media miss is just not that high quality
it's very short it's very superficial so
if you can really put the time in to
like a unique project I saw someone do a
project about he was in San Francisco
and he would get a lot of parking
tickets cuz he had a car and so he did a
project where he he actually emailed San
Francisco like the city government you
can email sometimes government's for
data and he got all the data on parking
tickets for the last 12 months and yeah
he just send requests and they sent him
back and then he like did a like
clustering analysis on where parking
tickets were most likely given in San
Francisco he wanted to find out if there
was a place to park that he can avoid
ticket to like some pattern like if he
could park there on Tuesday Wednesday he
didn't find anything I mean that and
that's one of the that's one of things a
lot of people don't realize with the
data Sciences sometimes you actually
don't discover anything or you just
disprove hypothesis or there's nothing
to discover right there's no answer to
your question and so that was that was
kind of this resolution to his project
there was no there was nowhere to park
in San Francisco oh you're safe well oh
where should be public like I think this
is gonna depend on your domain I would
say that for developers
so really software people dev to is a
really really great source I know like
I'm biased because I used to work for
them but dev 2 is really great um I also
think that there's a lot of validity and
owning your platform so having a place
where you publish your own blog post so
a portfolio site or spending up a
wordpress site or something along those
lines and you totally have ownership of
your content um medium is also another
place I'm not sure if it's still the
place to go for data scientists but
there was a lot of issues with it with
like web developers and so I think most
of them kind of moved off of it but
medium was a really big platform as well
I would take one last question looks
like we got one more from Karen and then
we'll wrap up well about asking
questions at the end of interview was an
important one to gauge their interest
and if they would you would fit in the
country a company um I asked things like
what the day-to-day for the job would
look like so that you have an example of
what is going to happen in that position
um I also had some really good ones as
well recently yeah I'm actually really
good at asking questions it's like one
of my skill set I do like a couple of
funny ones but one one I actually came
up with recently is I'm actually very
anti meeting culture like where you have
a lot of meetings so sometimes I'll ask
or I've thought to ask like oh how often
do you have meetings or why do you have
meetings when you work on projects to
see if people have regularly scheduled
meetings or if it's like more ad hoc
which is kind of what I like and then
one that I asked I used to ask a lot is
if you were CEO for a day like what
would you change
oh that's awesome that's yeah and so
really you really give some insight into
people into like what they don't like
about their company right because if
they could only change one thing if they
were the boss yeah a lot of people's
like like more like free cold brew I
think you were saying it yeah yeah I
think
at the end of the day a question that
shows there's a couple there's a couple
strategies right a question that shows
you've done research about the company
like you could have something about a
large project or initiative that's
become public and you could kind of ask
details about that and to show your
interest in the space you could talk to
about trends in the industry like what
someone thinks about like an upcoming
trend for example if you are
interviewing at GA you could talk about
like ISAs which are a type of financing
or like remote learning or things like
that yeah or anything that kind of
aligns with your interests as well
alright that's it for the event thanks a
lot
Ali for the presentation and taking a
bunch of questions and then we'll GA
will general assembly will send out an
email in a couple days with the
recording so everyone will have that as
well all right thank you everyone I will
end the recording now oh you're getting
a lot of things coming it's different
when you can't actually see the people
in person right yeah just bytes just by
chat no I'm seeing the chats now and I
like the QA and the chat yeah next to
each other but I'm also looking at the
wrong screen it's such a mess but thank
you all this is really fun I also meet
MIT's real meetups and pizza and all of
that as well very much so real life in
general are you doing any are youing any
talks in the future any like planned
chunks or webinars I guess or no they're
all virtual talks yeah I'm doing one for
her service conference next week um I
don't know I think I was supposed to
give a couple that I decided to pass on
because I don't know burnout burnout is
real yep I said really all right
