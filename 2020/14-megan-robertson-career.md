on the webinar platform for q a so
feel free to post any questions there
and when you know when it's a good
breaking point
megan will answer any questions that you
have
this webinar is being recorded
about me uh i am a statistician slash
data scientist
i am the founder of data umbrella and
i'm also an organizer for the new york
city chapter of pi ladies and
you can find me on twitter at reshma s
i'm
also on linkedin and github with the
same username

introduce herself
welcome megan
cool thanks um really excited to see
everybody in the chat from all over the
place really appreciate you guys taking
the time to
come and listen to what i have to say um
so today i'm going to be talking about
three lessons from three years of data
science so
going over what are some of the big
things i've learned so far in my career
so a little bit about me so my day today
i'm currently
a data scientist working in industry and
i've been
working with companies and consulting of
various sizes for about three years
i want to give a quick shout out to the
legal company of my current employer and
just
clarify that what i'm presenting today
are my own views do not represent the
views of my
employer at all
and another thing that i'm currently
working on is i'm
working on a book on data science
communication called mastering
communication and data science
um which will be hopefully out late of
2021 if all the deadlines are met um
and then in terms of my background so i
do have a masters of
statistical science and when i was in
grad school i
focused particularly on the areas of
beijing
statistics machine learning as well as
python and r programming
but say definitely more of my day-to-day
is spent in python and that is my
language of choice but i've also dabbled
in
r and i also have a background in sports
analytics
i interned for an mba team when i was in
school
and actually my love of sports and being
able to combine that with statistics
through sports analytics is
what really got me interested in
learning more about statistics and
eventually becoming a data scientist
like i
am today
so a quick overview of what this
presentation is going to
look like so these three areas project
management communication and
self-promotion
these are the three big areas that the
lessons i'm going to talk about today
fall into and these are definitely three
things that have been
pretty impactful to me and have helped
my career up to this point
and i do get a lot of requests for
students just asking questions about
data science and they often ask
you know what do i wish i had known back
when i was starting my career or when i
was applying to jobs
and these three things here are usually
make up the bulk of
the answers that i'll give to that so
i'm going to cover
what each of these three lessons are as
well as some ways that they show up
now in my day-to-day or how i go about
using these lessons
so first in the area of project
management
one big thing that was especially really
different from school that i learned
is that the most accurate model is not
necessarily
always the best model so
with project management i've definitely
also learned a lot about working with
people who aren't
data scientists i could probably say a
lot of lessons in this area but i think
this one
summarizes a lot of what i've learned
the most
you know in school you seem to always be
trying to fit that best model
in terms of some sort of predictive
accuracy whether it was
mean squared error area under the curve
or whatever metric you were looking at
and
i can distinctly remember being in like
the bowels of the basement the night
before
that project was due adding variables
looking for additional data trying to
improve
that performance and
this is not necessarily now how i
approach these projects
and in terms of why
it's important to know that the most
accurate model is not always the best
model
is there are lots of different things
that you need to consider when you're
developing a model for a project
it's very rare for you to be working
in a data science vacuum like maybe when
you're doing school projects
it was kind of just yourself and your
group working on something
but now in my day to day it's very
typical for me to be interacting with a
marketing team or a product team or a
strategy or leadership
and first of all you need to be able to
operate within constraints of deadlines
so sometimes i'll get requests come in
that have
like they need an answer by the next day
or within the week
i do also get some more long-term asks
but
you'll need to also be cognizant of
how how much time that you have to turn
this around
and obviously fitting a really
complicated model
takes a lot more time than maybe doing
something a little bit more basic
or that requires less computing time or
something
it's also important to note that complex
as you build more complex models this
can lead to increased
costs and something that i didn't have
to deal with as much before i started
working in a company
was the fact that my team now has a
budget
so it could be great that i want to fit
you know maybe some really complex
artificial intelligence neural network
type model
but at the end of the day you might only
see a marginal increase in that accuracy
so you have to think about not only the
time that it takes
to build that more complicated model
even if you do see maybe an increase in
that accuracy
but as they say like to be cliche
time is money so if i'm spending a lot
of my time that's only going to yield a
really
marginal return in that increased
accuracy
that takes away from my other priorities
that i'm working on
um and more complex models can also just
be more expensive from
a computing resource stand standpoint
as well and then sort of the last
reason behind this lesson is that when
you're doing black box models or ones
that are more complicated those can also
be really difficult to explain
so this is something that is special to
note
especially if you're working with
stakeholders who might be less familiar
with
data science is that at the end of the
day
you do need to provide some explanation
of how you got to the numbers that
you're delivering or
the recommendations that you're making
and it's a lot more complicated to
explain some
like big ai model versus something that
might be a little bit more simpler but
does the job almost as well
and you definitely want to make sure
that you can explain these things so
that you can build
trust within those teams but that i'll
touch on a little bit
more later when we get to the
communication section
so how i go about like really taking
this lesson in my day-to-day
so first of all is whenever i start
a project i tend to approach it in the
same way
and that is by starting simple and just
evaluating as i go
so the first thing that's really
important to do is just figure out
what has been done before and this can
be something that's either
internally or externally within your
company
so i'll usually try to see either within
my own team or if there's some other
data science
teams that work closely with us like
have they
built a model or some sort of report
that i might be able to capitalize on
and see what i can reuse and then
externally
we'll usually do some searches for
either white papers or some other
company data science
blogs where i can see
what they've applied in a similar
situation see if i can borrow anything
from that or adapt it for my own
situation
it's the next thing i'll do is then
figure out how to establish what i call
a baseline level
so say this is a modeling project in
that case i would start out by creating
a really simple model
and look at however i want to evaluate
that so maybe it's the mean squared
error
and this is really important because
then you have a score to beat
that as you try to maybe add more
variables to this model or just
look at other analysis options you have
something that you can
compare it with so in if you were to
just
jump right in and try to make something
really complex you throw a lot of time
into that
and at the end of the day it could be
the simplest thing that took
not as much time was actually your best
solution so it's really important that
you just get a sense of
okay what would be that simplest answer
and what sort of evaluation can i look
at to see if i beat it
then as i'm going throughout this
project i'm always looking
at that difference in performance so
for me personally um for my projects i'm
typically working with hundreds of
millions if not billions of
observation points so i'll typically fit
a model on like a smaller
data set look at the performance and see
if that will scale
so what i mean by look at that
performance difference is one
a more complex model that's going to
require
more time and more money to fit does it
perform better
and if the answer is yes does that
difference in performance justify the
amount of time and money that it would
take to scale it
and this is definitely a trade-off where
you need to think through
the pros and cons and it's something
that i think
you'll get a better sense of to when
you're working on projects and
collaborating with other teams to figure
out okay in what case
is it okay that we're going to lose you
know like a 0.25
difference versus something bigger
so the other big thing that i've learned
that
sort of falls into this area but i
wanted to
definitely have a call out for it
because this is an area that i
personally have learned so much out of
side of school in
is learning how to manage computing
costs
so when i introduced this lesson i said
that
oftentimes like teams are operating
under budgets now and as you make things
more and more complicated it requires
more time and more computing power to to
fit
and finish that analysis but
here are some things that i've learned
that are helpful in
kind of learning how to manage those
costs so
first of all is just learning
differences between
cluster settings so when i say
clusters i'm referring to basically like
these super computers that
i can access from my personal laptop by
logging into them and writing
code and sending it to them so
like google cloud computing resources if
you've worked with that you'll use
clusters in that
also aws or amazon web services
they also have these like super
computers that you can use
and i'll admit too this is something
that i'm still definitely learning from
like in my day to day but just really
understanding
the differences between the certain
types of processing units that can
you can have in a cluster as well as
what does it actually mean to give it
more
memory and what sort of things are
stored in memory there's a lot of stuff
out there
a lot of times the companies that you're
using for these resources will post
have a library of documents or
information about it that can be helpful
i also know some of the ones i've worked
with they
provide like an office hours or have
people you can reach out to to ask
questions i'd say that's definitely a
great
source but again like this is something
i'm definitely
still learning as well um so
i recognize that it seems very easy when
i say learn the differences but in
reality it's not
always that simple and then the other
thing
in terms of managing computing costs is
thinking about
ways that you can reduce the size of the
data
so say for example that we fit
on a hundred percent of our training set
but
if we fit on 75 percent of our training
set it would take
less time and there's only a small
reduction in accuracy
so just thinking through like all these
different ways of can i actually reduce
the size of the data that i'm running
through this model
and still get comparable results
can also think about do i actually need
to be including all of these features in
the model that i'm training
maybe there's some that are correlated
enough that you can drop them or think
about
just getting down that size especially
if you're getting to a more complicated
model
and then i'll say the last thing that
i've definitely gotten better
with is just using
being able to take advantage of the
efficiency of parallel computing
so when i say parallel computing
there are say i want to fit a bunch of
smaller models
and combine all of their powers to make
a really
complicated like bigger model
i could use parallel computing in that
sense that i could use a bunch of these
different super computers
send smaller models out to each of them
and they'll all run at the same time so
that can reduce your time and your
computational power as well
so again these are just a few areas that
maybe at the end of the day you find out
that simple model like
does okay but you really want to get to
that complicated model
these are some ways that you can go
about doing that
so before i get to the next lesson i'm
just going to check
the chat real quick to see if we have
any questions come up
you also there'll be time at the end as
well um
but okay i don't see any right now so
we'll
move to
communication so
in the area of communication the big
lesson here is that it's really
important
to be able to explain your job to
non-technical peers
so when you're in school you're
typically you know speaking the same
language
as your peers and your professors you
can get up there and give a project
presentation and just
drop all of the jargon out there about
parameterizations and loss functions and
ai
big data all of that stuff but
when you're working as a data scientist
especially if you're in like an
industry role you're going to be
working with a bunch of teams who aren't
data scientists and who
maybe have taken an intro stats course
so
they don't necessarily need to know the
in-depth details you're not going to get
up
in a meeting and start writing greek
symbols
on the board but you do need to be able
to explain some of these more complex
things that you're doing
to an audience that doesn't have that
same background as you
so why this is important i touched on
this first point in the previous section
but it's really important that you build
trust and develop a relationship with a
lot of these teams that you're working
with
this is especially important if you're
collaborating with a team that might not
be as familiar with
data science um
and that's because they need to
understand
more about like how you come about your
numbers and such because you wouldn't
expect
oh okay i'm going to give you the output
of this model they're not just going to
go apply your recommendations blindly
they want to understand where they come
from
and need to have a basic understanding
of that
being able to explain your job is also
really important in terms of being able
to educate teams on the data science
process so this really has to do with
the first point as well
because you want to have a
collaborations with teams where
they understand you understand their
expectations they understand your
expectations especially when it comes to
timelines and resources
i've definitely been in situations where
people think
oh data science i'm just going to take
you know
two and a half excel spreadsheets email
it to you you can put it in your magic
black box or crystal ball and all of a
sudden all of this great
information is going to come out because
we're using the data um
that's often not how things really
happen um
so being able to explain like
how complicated things work can really
help you just educate the people that
you're working with
on that process and make sure and really
ensure that you have successful
collaborations moving forward
and then the last point i'll say about
why this is important
is this can really help you develop a
data science brand
if you're very good at going out and
talking about what you do especially to
a diverse group of audiences and this is
something that will be
important within your own company in
your own role but also outside
because my previous two points you don't
want data science to be seen as the team
that just
sits off in the corner and writes all of
their code and does math and then comes
out with some numbers
you want you do you want people to
recognize you as an
expert in terms of how they can get the
most
information out of their data how it can
help them inform their strategy
but you are also relying on the
expertise of the other teams that you're
working with as well
and you want them to help inform you
throughout that partnership
and then in terms of outside of your
company um
if you're interested in like going to
conferences and talking about your work
or
writing blog posts or having a presence
like that that can help your career
it's really important to have these
communication skills as well
and you can maybe even get some new
opportunities out of them
so what are some of the ways that i go
about
um using this communication lesson and
applying it
so this is really a topic that i could
talk about
forever but i'll give like a very
kind of high level of how i think about
some of this stuff and definitely
if you have questions about it like
throw them in the chat or
you can also reach out to me after if
you have something else you want to talk
about more
but i always think about when i'm
presenting something that's more
complicated first
thinking about how can i break this
topic down into smaller chunks
so suppose we have a situation where
i have fit a decision tree model
to help a marketing team predict if
someone's going to click on an ad
so i would think about the different
parts of a decision tree
individually and then think about how i
can present them all together
so the great thing about a decision tree
is it's basically just a flow chart
that we're figuring out the structure of
using math
and a lot of times if you're working
with people of more of a business
background
like they've definitely seen a flow
chart
so in this case it's really great to
have like that example that they've
probably seen like this
image before um
and to that second point it's a decision
tree at its essence is grouping together
the most similar observations
so we know that at the top of this
flowchart we have all of
in this case our customers of interest
and we're putting them into groups
based on who's most similar at that
point
and then lastly it's always important to
just think through what are some of the
assumptions and limitations of a
particular model that or analysis that
you're presenting
so like for example in the case of the
just with any model you can always talk
about the risk of over
fitting so if i
have some data where the age
range of the customers are maybe only
between 18 and 35
that model is not really going to apply
well to someone outside of that age
range for example
and it's just important to be
responsible about sharing any
assumptions and limitations
just because at the end of the day if
they you know take this analysis or take
these numbers from your
presentation and apply it elsewhere they
just need to understand
you don't want you don't want people to
basically take your analysis and kind of
run off with it and start applying it to
a bunch of different areas that they
shouldn't
and you just want to make sure that
you're getting that stuff across as well
so the other way i think about um
being able to communicate more
effectively with the other teams that i
work with
is one to like walk through the model
with the
relatable and simple example so suppose
this here
shows like a very simple version of that
decision tree
for answering the question of okay will
this customer click on the ad
so i personally love putting visuals on
size especially for this
because it gives you something to point
to you can
um like really just lay things out
clearly for people to see
so say for example our simple and
relatable example
we're just going to pick one person and
see how does this model work in
predicting
are they going to click on this ad or
not so up here
in this top we have all of our people
are all in one group these are all of
our consumers who have been shown
some sort of ad so say we want to
predict for me
am i going to click on that ad so we
would go down to this
age level and here you can remind them
how those buckets are split up it's how
we've been able to quantitatively say
these people are very similar to each
other i'd say it's pretty
rare when you're working with like a
non-data science team that they would
ask for the specifics in terms of
like what function did you use to define
that
um so i wouldn't worry so much about
those details but just
know okay the people who end up in this
bucket together they're all the most
similar to each other at that level
so for me i would go down to that 26
plus group
and then say okay either customers are
shown an
ad on instagram or one on facebook for
me
i was shown an ad on instagram so it
would follow that flow chart down
and we'd see within all the 26 plus year
olds shown an ad on instagram
only 34 of them clicked so we're going
to predict that i don't click
because the majority of people did not
click
in that instance and
if you're presenting to like say this
was the marketing team or something else
like definitely
even if your actual analysis is a little
bit more complicated really try to get
it to
a more simple example where you can just
walk through each of these so
i just walked through for example what
this like a simple version of this
decision tree
looked like but maybe in reality i had
more
variables or more something but this at
least gets them
to the fundamental concepts of we're
really just grouping together people who
are super similar
and then we get to a point we're just
going to predict what the majority of
those people said
all right i'm not not seeing a question
there
um so then we can move on to
the last uh the last
area and lesson in regards of
self-promotion
so with this and this is definitely i
think one of the things i've
learned that has had the most impact on
my career it's also
one of the most challenging things is to
know that
you are your own best advocate
so for me i think i definitely got used
to being in school and
if you study hard really learn the
material
put together a good presentation that's
reflected in your grade so
at the end of the day good work
typically seems to be noticed but
this isn't necessarily always the case
and this is something that can be
especially challenging especially at a
larger company
and it's not necessarily something
that's nefarious at all
but when you're working with a lot of
other people there are a lot of
different projects and priorities going
on
sometimes you just have to like raise
your hand not literally but
say hey look at me look at this really
hard project i just finished and
i definitely had to get used to
promoting myself and talking about my
own accomplishments
because i found that i was constantly
worried about oh am i going to come
across as i'm bragging even though
i'm actually i actually wasn't but
i feel like especially in my first three
years and
tending to be the more junior person in
the room i also would doubt myself in
terms of oh well
sure i did finish this project but you
know i'm sure someone who is a senior
level could have done it so much more so
or so much better um
and in terms of why this is a really
important
lesson is i just want to start off by
saying that
like it is important to know that you
are an asset to your team
so even if like you're still in school
studying this working group projects or
if you're someone who's working
as a data scientist now like
recognize that your skills are valuable
you make an impact and that you would
not get to the point
where you are today if someone else
didn't recognize your potential and
i know imposter syndrome gets thrown
around
a lot especially in our field and it's
going to make you always have that
little voice in the back of your head
that's like
oh no like i just got lucky they didn't
actually you know
oh they didn't actually read my
application that closely or someone else
you know should be here more than me
and i know that's not always hard to
ignore but just
definitely like take some time and
recognize what are some things that
you're good at
um to try to combat some of
some of that stuff um
and another thing that i think
is why this being your own advocate
is important falls under in relation to
mentors and advocates
um those are also very important
um i'll talk a little bit more about
like
how to go about finding those in the
next couple slides but
just some definitions to provide here so
a mentor is somebody who
i think of as like providing assistance
and helping you out with career
navigation
so um i've had mentors who are
data scientists i've also had mentors
outside of the space who i typically go
to more for
just like professional questions but
you would go to them to ask like oh hey
i just i'm facing this situation at work
how do you think i should proceed or
they can really be helpful in guiding
the next steps of your career and
helping you figure out what you want to
do
on the other hand an advocate is
somebody who is
helping to actually create opportunities
for you and will go to bat for you
um so like this can typically be someone
like a more senior member on your team
or even your manager and that
they know what you want to do and if
something comes up that you're
interested in or that would benefit for
you like
they'll go to whoever they need to and
say like yes i hope like i support this
person
i think they'd be a great fit for it and
really help you in that sense
um so again they could be potentially
the same person but also um there's a
pretty noticeable difference between the
two
and then the other reason why it's
important to be your own best
advocate is how this can help you with
career
development so when you're advocating
for yourself you'll definitely be more
likely to have a direction that really
interests you or work on projects that
are more
exciting to you um
i think for me i do recognize that like
saying career development
especially after i just got in my first
job seemed like a very
overwhelming thing because i applied to
so many jobs in the beginning
i finally got one can take a breath but
now it seems like oh well now i have to
figure out what i want to do next and
what do i want to work on and all of
that
um i'm going to touch on career
development also in the next couple
slides so don't
feel too overwhelmed by that because
that's something definitely
i was um but it doesn't have to be as
like you don't have to have a concrete
five ten year plan
there are other ways that you can think
about it and advocate for yourself so
that
you end up just learning things that are
interesting to you and really
getting you closer to your own personal
goals
alright so how to then
go about advocating for yourself
one is the dreaded networking world word
so it's really important to network
inside and outside of your company
one way to do that first of all is to
contribute to any regular
regular summary content so
different companies will do this
differently but typically either once a
week or once a month they'll either have
a meetup
or a stand up or some sort of email or
report that goes out that highlights
you know what are some of the big
projects or what are some of the things
that people are working on
so if they do that wherever you are
definitely like
think about contributing to that talking
about the work that you're doing getting
it done
if one doesn't exist but it seems like
the team's big enough or the company's
big enough that would be like a good
idea
maybe think about like leading that
initiative to start one um
just again it's especially at those
larger companies you just want to make
sure people
recognize what you're doing they see
your name in relation to the work that
you're putting out there
um another point to this that's not
necessarily about like contributing to
regular summary content
but typically a lot of companies will
have like an annual review
process so something that i'll do is
even just keep a
like a note on my work computer of some
of the big projects that i'm working on
and what are either some of the big
breakthroughs or the new skills that i
picked up on that
just because you know 12 months go by
and it can be hard to remember
everything that you did especially this
year because
three months feels like 10 years but
just
get used to keeping track of all the
different things you've done and skills
you've learned
because that can come in handy when you
then go at the end of the year to have
those conversations with your manager
another thing in terms of networking how
to go about it
and this is something that i like
absolutely hated when i started out
is just set up one-on-ones or
to use sort of the business lingo coffee
chats with people
um this can be definitely the people
inside a company if you already
are working that either work
tangentially
tangent i can't say that even a math
person
that work very closely with your team
maybe or even in other departments
um or if you're a student or working to
looking to break into data science it
can also just be people
that you find whose work that you're
interested in
so for me i started out by like reaching
out within
an alumni network so whether that be
through
a college or if you do a boot camp or
any sort of program like that oftentimes
i'll have a directory of people that you
can reach out to
um and that i found really helpful at
least to start out with because
i could then there was a common ground
that i had
um just that connection and
i would also recommend for this like
definitely plan some questions and
talking points ahead of time
i think for me i always found this
stressful because it was like what if we
don't have anything to talk about and
all of that but if you come with some
questions ahead of time um and you get
more practice with this you'll
definitely get
more comfortable having those
conversations with other people um
and i will say too i think one of the
biggest things that i
why i did not like this at first as a
student is i always felt like i was
going out and asking people for things
and not really having as much
to offer in return but i'd say
definitely like if people
respond and are willing to talk with you
like
if you're reaching out like as a student
they probably already know that it's
going to be more of like answering
questions but
also know that like you don't have to
get really far in your career to then
like have people that you network in
network with have a benefit from knowing
you as well
it's like for example like one to two
years
into my own career after i met someone
at um
an event that i went to like i ended up
helping him find an
intern to hire so just know that you
don't have to be
like super senior or have done all these
projects to necessarily have like a
networking relationship
where you're also helping other people
as well
so then start with this last one um
just so i'm not sure where i dropped off
but
so it's really important when you're
reaching out to these people to do
research before you send a message um
it's definitely pretty easy to tell if
someone's just copying and pasting those
same messages to a bunch of different
people and changing the name
so take a little bit of time read their
blogs
look on linkedin and see what sort of
information can you add in there
just to help yourself stand out a little
bit and show that you're also
invested because um the reality is that
a lot of
these people are probably receiving
messages from like
a ton of people and you want to make
sure that you can
differentiate yourself from the group a
little bit
so the other way that i apply this
lesson then in my
day today is actively thinking about
career development so again this is
something that when i first got my job
my first data science job seemed very
overwhelming
of just finally i finished school i got
the degree i landed a job like let's
take a deep breath and then it seemed
like well no now i have to
it's very overwhelming to then think
about okay what does the future look
like
um but i'm here to tell you it does not
have to be that overwhelming
so just a couple of things i've learned
in regards to this
so first of all in data science
typically
you'll see um jobs
or two different career paths exist of
you can either
become in what's called an individual
contributor or more of a management role
so typically and again this isn't the
same for every company but
you'll come in as a data scientist there
might be like one or two senior levels
above that
and then you get to like a fork in the
road where one is that ic path one is a
manager
so what it means then to be an
individual
contributor is you are somebody who
spends more time like writing code
building models
working on projects you might have one
or two
people report to you but at the end of
the day more of your time is still spent
like coding and doing the math and
statistics side of things
versus someone who goes more down a
manager path
they'll be somebody who is like who's
leading a larger team
and helping guide a lot more of this
long-term strategy and priorities of
things
so you'll typically they'll typically
spend a little bit more time
in meetings in terms of understanding
different requests that come in for the
team
figure out can they take on more
requests what has more priority
and they'll also they're responsible for
more people and will also typically
play a large part in career development
for their team as well
so again that's just something that's
good to know
um because as you're working on
different projects and doing different
things
it's just good to get a sense of to this
next point
what type of work makes you happy like
if you find yourself
hating going to all these meetings
around project planning and all of that
that's probably okay if you don't like
that maybe management
isn't necessarily what you want um
but definitely just even thinking about
what types of work
makes you happy is really important
um because again you don't have to make
this crazy five-year plan
but in your day-to-day think about what
are the things that you enjoy
what are your favorite things to do like
what is the stuff that you don't quite
look forward to doing what do you want
to learn more about
so for me i found for example that i
really liked
being able to be like the person
in between data science and the people
that we work with in terms of
like i still spend a lot of my
day-to-day writing code and building
models but
i really liked being able to take all
the
analysis that i did and help somebody
who wasn't in data science do their job
better
or answer their questions or really help
shape that
um like answer their questions that
might be shaping the overall strategy
and then i've also found i personally
really enjoy
the opportunities i've had with
mentoring more junior employees and
helping them
start out some of their first projects
so
for me personally it's like okay that
means at this point like i'm more
interested in
probably thinking about that manager
path but again like career development
doesn't have to be this crazy
i'm going to have all the details of my
next few years planned out it can be as
simple as identifying what do you like
to do what don't you like to do
and once you figure that out
it's really important that you share
those goals and don't be quiet about
what you want
so this is a great thing to just talk
about with your manager and some of your
other colleagues
because if they know what you want like
for example your manager is going to be
aware of
opportunities and upcoming projects
often times before you are
and if they know like okay hey like
megan really likes working with more
junior employees that she can help
mentor and build their skills like
here's a project where i know like she
could take more of a leadership role in
so don't be afraid to talk about that
because you want other people just to be
aware of what you're interested in as
well
so then to wrap it up with just a quick
summary of what the three lessons are so
first of all better accuracy doesn't
necessarily mean that it's a better
model
at the end of the day your best solution
is going to be the one
that meets the project means but also
really makes the best use
of time and money when compared to your
other priorities
again it's a lot easier said than done
in that
sentence there but this is something
that you'll get a better sense of
as you start doing more projects
it's also really important to develop
strong communication skills
you need that so you can build
relationships with other teams
um build a sense of trust among the
people that you're working with
and it can also be great if you do want
to
pursue some opportunities in terms of
speaking at conferences or at meetups
and then lastly know that you are your
own best advocate
so even when that imposter syndrome
creeps in and you doubt yourself don't
be afraid to speak up for yourself
to your home your own horn about your
accomplishments and
really be sure to go after what it is
you want and just make sure that you're
sharing your career goals
with the people that you work with
and that's what i have for you guys
today
so here i have my twitter handle as well
as my website so if you have
any questions or anything that you want
to ask about or chat about you can
definitely
dm me on twitter or i have like a
contact field on my website
as well but i'm also happy to take
what questions we have time for now hey
megan so
there is a question in the q a i could
read it
from sandeep it is related to the first
section
could you highlight some of the at-scale
computing methodologies that you found
to be
key the best ways to learn them
yeah for sure um so
i'd say for me personally the biggest
things that i've
learned that has been helpful um has
been using
pi spark um
in terms of the best way to like
learn it right now it's a little
different because i feel like when i was
in school there wasn't as much of a
focus on like big
data computing so i personally just
learned a lot of them by
okay here's this problem i have at work
and we got to get it done
somehow so kind of trial by fire um
but i'd say like figuring out one good
thing to really
learn more about like i was saying
before is parallel computing
so pi spark you can actually use
that like implementation of using the
spark
language in python that can help you run
things in parallel
and i honestly like i said a lot of i
learned was just like i need to figure
this out um
but i would say definitely look into
parallel computing
the spark language
um just because there's a lot of stuff
that fits in there in terms of figuring
out
or that explains like how it works and
what the difference is between
the terminology that they use and then i
would say just
go and like find some large data set
um there's some machine learning data
repositories out there with some good
data sets of just
download it and like just start trying
to write code and see
okay if i just fit a model like this
versus if i maybe use like that pi spark
in parallel for example like being able
to see
that difference but um
on the top of my head i can't really
think of any particular
good resources but that's also because i
just kind of had to learn this by trial
by fire
um question is from sandra and
um she asks how do you share your
accomplishments
outside of your company without
revealing proprietary or confidential
information
uh yes so this definitely
hits a little close to home for me per
my disclaimer at the beginning
um so i think how i
typically go about it is
well one i just start by thinking about
okay what are
my accomplishments like if i could say
anything for example like what would i
want to go out and like either
put on like a linkedin bullet point or
something like that
and then from there i kind of work
backwards
in terms of like okay well what do i
know i definitely can't
talk about um
and then once i get to like i have sort
of not a watered-down version but like
removing some of that proprietary or
confidential stuff
then typically i'll like ask my manager
or like talk to the appropriate
department about that
um if i need to but
um i'm trying to i know this sounds like
a very vague
answer um just because
for me like because i'm technically
giving an external presentation this
answer i'm giving is very different than
what i would tell you individually
but um i would say there's definitely
like think about
could you talk about like maybe you
worked on developing a new feature for
something and you know it impacted like
ex customers like usually something like
that um
quantifying it that way you can usually
do as long as you're not
you know talking about that underlying
model or technology that you use for
that
okay the next question is from kenisha
which is
when you first started in industry were
there any technology or techniques that
we
that you didn't know how to use or do
that were necessary for the job
and if so how were you able to learn it
was it via company training
or self training
yeah so i think for me definitely the
biggest
thing was just figuring out how to work
with
very large data sets i think i had
maybe one lecture in grad school where
the professor was like
this is aws and
i honestly didn't remember anything from
that so i think
definitely like learning that cloud
computing stuff was helpful
that was a combination of just
having people either on my team who had
background in that really help
out learn that but also just kind of
diving into a project where i needed to
know it
and looking at code that was either on
blog post or elsewhere in applying it
i do think that there's a lot more out
there in terms about
um having like just the background
of how these different technologies work
so i'd say that's definitely one thing
i've learned a lot about on the job
and then the other thing i think would
just be
like database querying so i personally
use sql
and part of that i feel like it was my
first
i i had done like the sql course on like
khan academy
or something which was very good but
until i had that like first internship
where
i was actually going through and
generating features from the data and
joining tables like
then i really felt like i mastered sql
so i think for both of those it's really
a combination of
like doing an online course or reading
blog post but then
also like having to implement it on my
own
okay thank you uh the next question is
from kailande
which is do you think it is essential to
have a data science internship before
landing one's first full-time position
specifically for people with non-cs
computer science backgrounds but with
data experience with r and python
through quantitative research
experiences
yeah so i think that it's definitely
helpful to have
an internship um it's not necessarily
going to be
a deal breaker all the time again
that'll depend on
the company as well but i think
when we're like when a company is
looking to hire a data scientist they
really want somebody who
has um like
a quantitative background so just
in terms of understanding like
probability like
intro stats maybe a little bit of
machine learning um
it's great that you'll know code um
but i think as long as you can
demonstrate that
you have the different skills necessary
to be able to take
some sort of business question or
request
think about it figure out how you can
translate that into something
quantitative
that you can look at with the data that
you have
be able to run whatever analysis you
think makes sense and then communicate
that
back to whoever it is you're working
with like that's fundamentally what a
data scientist does and what companies
are interested in so yes having an
internship can be a great way to get
that
experience but you can also demonstrate
that
with other ways i think one of the
biggest questions i'll always get is
i'm trying to find my first data science
job but
i don't have any experience how can i
get experience if i don't have one
so you can also think about like the
stuff that you're doing either in school
or even in your free time or through
kaggle
just think about okay what where can i
take a data set
find that interesting story using my
technical skills
and be able to communicate what's
important from it so again like
data science will help with that an
internship will help with that but it's
not necessarily a deal breaker
okay the next question is from neely
which is could you share
more about how you landed your first
data science job out of grad school
uh yes um so
i will say that i first
started out in a very inefficient manner
of coming out of school i was like okay
well
i'm just going to apply to as many
places as possible because
at the end of the day somebody will like
respond to me
um and yes that was
true but i found that it was a lot
of you know effort and time put into
submitting these
online applications and i wasn't
necessarily seeing the return that i got
that i would have wanted and i think
like part way through that process i
from like reaching out to some of my
other classmates or just people that i
knew
um in the area i kind of shifted my
approach to them more thinking about
like
building a network as a way to go about
finding jobs so the reality is like if a
company posts a data science
position typically they really get
inundated with a ton of applicants
so even if you are the most qualified
qualified applicant at the end of the
day like you might your resume just
might get buried and like
because so many people are applying so i
shifted more towards of like
focusing on networking but networking
with the sense of like i definitely want
to make sure that i'm connecting with
people who are working at companies i'm
interested or areas
like specific areas that i'm interested
in um
just because again like i i do not
recommend going out and just asking
random people
to refer you to a job but i found that
like if you
go out and like have conversations and
ask them like what it's like to work at
their company
and all of that stuff like a lot of
times it would just come up organically
they'd say oh if you see a position
you're interested in let me know and
sometimes there wasn't a position open
at that company but down the line like
something came up that i could
talk to them about so again i did have
success in terms of i got
job offers from just applying on
websites but i found that my time was
much more effect
effective in taking that networking
approach well yes i'm still job hunting
but
there's also just a lot of great
information that i learned along the way
about working in data science as well
okay the next question is from sandeep
could you please provide some pointers
on deciding on a domain
even if i don't have much experience in
it i'm sure you found it cool to find a
job in the domain that interested
interested you from the outset
yeah um definitely so
i think one of the cool things about
data science is it basically
you can like every company has it for
the most part or not company but
you can be in retail you can be in
sports you can be in medicine all over
the place and
i think for me like my
initial job right out of school i was
working for a now defunct company
that um like tracked engagement for
online publications so wasn't
necessarily something that i was
personally
super interested in but i think for me i
saw the opportunity of
like i knew i wanted to be in a position
where i could be working a lot with a
lot of different teams and helping them
do their
that job better um
i think also a big part of it too was
when i had
interviewed and like meeting the people
that i
would eventually work with i could tell
that
like one that they were people that i
would
like personality-wise like got
along with um i could tell that
the head of the team was like very
invested in
building out the data science team
within the company as well as helping
his employees to develop so i would say
like definitely if it's in an industry
you're not familiar with kind of just
see
get a sense of what sort of projects
that they're working on because like my
first job i was definitely
not passionate about online
art like online publication engagement
metrics
but i did find that
there was a really big benefit in terms
of like
being able to work with the team that i
was in and the projects that the team
was working on like i got to learn
new things obviously about that area but
also things that really interested me in
terms of new
techniques that i hadn't learned before
yeah and you know just to add to that i
think one thing that i've learned is it
is interesting like how many
how much skills and knowledge from one
domain are transferable to another
domain
for sure
next question is from neely which is um
yes we have time for question
do you have any tips on writing good or
effective data science
linkedin bullet points
yeah so i think for that um
i think a common thing that gets thrown
around that
i do agree with um
is it can be helpful to try to figure
out a way to quantify
like projects that you're working on so
if you did a project that like
influenced like say some marketing
campaign for 50 000 people for example
or
you know if you implemented an
a b test that ultimately like
your recommendation cause like x dollars
and
increase in revenue or something um i'd
say
that's definitely put that in there
um because that can be very helpful for
when
somebody who's maybe not as familiar
with the data science is looking at it
so like maybe
someone who's an hr is in charge of
hiring for a position for example
because like by seeing a number they'll
at least be able to get a sense of
the impact of it um i think also
highlighting any instances where you're
like i feel like teamwork is always
something that can sometimes get
overlooked
so talking about like the teams that
you've worked with or collaborated with
because at the end of the day like
maybe if you're at some super research
heavy position but
otherwise you're going to be working
with people who aren't data scientists
so they want to get a sense of
do you have those communication skills
as well
um so i think i whenever i'm
updating things i'll usually or like if
i'm updating my resume for whatever
reason i'll definitely try to add a
bullet point
that focuses on some of those
non-technical skills as well
um and the last thing i'll say too about
like data science linkedin bullet points
or even bullet points on your resume is
like if you
are gonna like definitely mention like
the different coding languages that you
use for a project or the models or
algorithms that you used
but if you're going to mention them
there
definitely make sure that you can answer
a question about them
just i've been in cases where i've
interviewed people and they say oh yes i
fit this this and this model um
definitely make sure you can then ask
some questions about like
the math behind that model or how you
went about doing that
so if you're having bullet points from
like earlier projects
definitely make sure that you review
those kind of so they're fresh before
you go into an interview because
we definitely look at linkedin profiles
as well
and there's one more question here which
is um have you experienced gender bias
or microaggressions in your career and
how have you navigated that
yeah um yeah so i think
being a woman in a
usually male dominated field this has
definitely
come up i can think of many
kind of different experiences that fall
under this but like
i think of one example in grad school
where kind of just a group working on a
problem set and
i shared the correct like oh no we
should try this and it turns out being
right and
myself and my friend were the only ones
that were listened to me and then we had
a
a male student in the group say the same
thing 30 minutes later and i was like
wait
literally i already said that but
i think it's something that is
definitely
getting better um
i think that people now especially with
some of the events that have happened
this year are more likely to
kind of recognize that okay like people
who tend to be minority in spaces like
they do get treated differently at times
and i don't even acknowledge when that
happens all the time so i think
for me one it's been very helpful to
find
not support groups but like all
like one of my mentors that i have like
all often like talk to her about some of
this stuff because she's
in a more senior position than me
and just like that can even just be
helpful in terms of like okay
am i crazy like just having some other
people to talk about who are also
experiencing it is great
and then i think two i definitely have
gotten
better at kind of figuring out okay
when something happens okay what's the
best way to address this and like when
to bring it up
um and i think too like i've definitely
it can be uncomfortable at times as well
as it's definitely not easy but i'd say
one of the biggest things that i've
gotten more comfortable
with doing than that i would find a lot
in meetings at times
that i would like be interrupted a lot
or like people weren't really
quite like paying as much attention to
my points
and again like this is not necessarily
easy and can be
uncomfortable but like if some i got
better at okay if someone tries to cut
me
off and i'm not done like i'll just keep
talking
and then usually they'll get the hint um
i think too also just like identifying
people that you can trust within
your team as well can be helpful too to
kind of have an ally with that
it's like for example in one of my
previous roles like
i had someone who was male who like
in meetings and this was like i
didn't even ask at all but i was like
afterwards was like wow thank you i
really appreciate that
where like if i got interrupted he'd be
like well wait
megan wasn't done talking like you need
like let's hear what
she has to say um so i think kind of
finding
just people who you trust that can maybe
help you with some of that
but then also recognize that like at
some times you might have to have that
uncomfortable moment of like
being in the meeting and just keeping
talking while someone's
interrupted you or another thing that
i'll do
from time to time is like if i say
something and then the classic you know
someone else repeats it and everyone's
like oh wow that's great
all done ask oh like can you highlight
how that's different from what i just
said
um so again it's not easy
um but definitely like try to find that
support system as well
so that you can have like a place to
vent also about it
too because that can be definitely
therapeutic
question which is from astato
which is sorry if i mispronounced it
did you work with a project that uses
deep learning models if yes
what a takeaway can you give about deep
learning framework which one
would you recommend um
i have done some stuff with the deep
learning models
in terms of i've had a one or two
projects that
where was looking at building various
neural networks for things um
i personally don't have too much
experience in terms of like actually
bringing it from like the development
stage into production just because it
didn't
really work in our use case um so i
don't
personally have like a specific
recommendation about deep learning
frameworks right now
um i do know some people who use
tensorflow though
and really love it but like i said i
only
i didn't really make it past the
exploratory
stage in my own experience
well megan thank you so much um
for presenting um we had a lot of
questions and a lot of interest it was a
really great presentation
um yeah did you have any um final words
you wanted to say
um
i mean i think this was really just the
three
big themes i feel like really summarize
what i've done
so far but i want to say thanks to all
of you again
for showing up and asking some great
questions and definitely like feel free
to reach out
like on my contact informations up here
as well and just know that
it can feel very overwhelming especially
early on in your career
in data science and definitely like try
not to get too discouraged by what you
see
other people doing and just know if you
follow
what you're passionate about and what
you want to learn about like things are
going to fall into place for you
and you'll end up finding something that
you like doing
okay thank you
