## About the Event
NumPy is a fundamental, open-source Python library for N-dimensional array programming used extensively for data analysis and scientific programming. As a community-driven project, NumPy is mainly sustained by open-source contributions. 
This talk focuses on avenues of contribution to the project documentation, an integral part of the software.
