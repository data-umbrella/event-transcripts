## About the Event
This one-hour tutorial introduces new users to version 5 of PyMC, a powerful Python, open source library for probabilistic programming and Bayesian statistical modeling. Participants will learn the fundamentals of PyMC, best practices for installation and setup, and gain hands-on experience building their first Bayesian model.
