## About the Event
Discover Polars, the high-performance DataFrame library revolutionizing data analysis in Python. Built on Rust, Polars offers unparalleled speed and efficiency, outperforming pandas, Dask, and even PySpark. Explore its innovative features like lazy evaluation, memory efficiency, and automatic multi-threading, designed to handle large datasets with ease.

In this session, you'll learn practical techniques for data manipulation and advanced transformations. We will demonstrate Polars' syntax and capabilities, making it accessible even if you’re new to Polars. Join us to elevate your Python data analysis to the next level.
This presentation covers:

- Section 1: What is Polars and how does it compare to pandas?
- Section 2: Getting Started with Polars in Python
- Section 3: Advanced Data Analysis with Polars
- Section 4: Should you switch to Polars?
