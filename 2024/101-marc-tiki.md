## About the Event
This presentation will be a demo of how a power user can create a database web application using Tiki Trackers. Tiki Trackers is the database creation tool of Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware. It started as a bug tracker and evolved over the years to become a general purpose database creation tool with over 40 field types. Combined with Tiki's other features, it becomes a no-code/low-code platform. Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware is the Free/Libre/Open Source Web Application with the most built-in features. The community philosophy is to collaborate on features, and not fragment efforts in various plugins. Over 400 people (some representing organizations) have contributed source code to Tiki since 2002. Tiki is the largest component of WikiSuite. While Wikipedia is the broadest unified body of knowledge, WikiSuite is the most comprehensive and integrated Open Source enterprise solution.
