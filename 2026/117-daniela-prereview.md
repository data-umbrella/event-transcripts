## About the Event
This session introduces participants to PREreview, a community-driven platform designed to make peer review more open, inclusive, and equitable. We’ll explore the current research publishing landscape—from preprints to common challenges in traditional peer review—and discuss why transparent, community-centered reviewing matters.

Participants will learn how PREreview connects with open-source infrastructure and platforms like ORCID and Zenodo, see a demo of how to review manuscripts and datasets, and gain practical tools from the Open Reviewers workshop to write constructive, socially-conscious reviews. We’ll also share upcoming developments, ways to get involved, and how to engage through programs like PREreview Champions.

### Outline
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

- Describe what PREreview is, why it was created, and how it fits into today’s research publishing landscape.
- Explain the role of preprints and open peer review, including the benefits and challenges of current review systems.
- Understand how PREreview supports open scholarship, including collaborations with ORCID, Zenodo, and other open communities.
- Use the PREreview platform to find, write, and publish constructive open reviews of manuscripts and datasets.
- Apply best practices for socially-conscious, constructive peer review, drawing from the Open Reviewers workshop.
- Identify upcoming PREreview features and ways to get involved—through reviewing, contributing to open source, or joining the Champions program.

## About the Speaker

Daniela Saderi, Ph.D. - ORCID: 0000-0002-6109-0367 - Dr. Daniela Saderi is the Co-founder and Executive Director of PREreview, a non-profit advancing open, community-centered peer review of early research objects by supporting researchers and experts—especially early-career and historically excluded scholars.

She earned her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Oregon Health & Science University in 2019, studying auditory processing in mammals, and was a 2018–2019 Mozilla Fellow for Open Science. Daniela envisions a scholarly ecosystem grounded in trust, care, and collective wisdom, where knowledge flows freely as a shared inheritance rather than a commodity.
