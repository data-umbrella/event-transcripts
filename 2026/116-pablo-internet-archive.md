## About the Event
With a mission of "Universal Access to All Knowledge", the Internet Archive is building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form for the last 29 years.

In this talk, core infrastructure engineer Pablo Duboue will walk us through the project and its external APIs, which he helps maintain. As a former data scientist himself, Pablo will discuss how the
different APIs can be useful for data scientists.

### Outline
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
- The Internet Archive Project: history, core infrastructure engineering, the Wayback Machine, Open Library, digitization centres.
- Using the IA through the Website: creating accounts, uploading material, derivatives, collections.
- Using the IA through the Python `ia` Tool: instalation, IA APIs, IA and crawlers.
- Contributing to the IA: uploading your own models / data, volunteering, copyright reform, donations
