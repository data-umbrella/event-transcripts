## About the Event
Research data is foundational to data science, analytics, and research across disciplines—but sharing, preserving, and reusing data effectively remains a challenge.

In this Data Umbrella webinar, speakers from the Dataverse Project and the Global Dataverse Community Consortium (GDCC) will introduce Dataverse, a widely used, open source research data repository platform that supports the FAIR Guiding Principles. Dataverse enables researchers and institutions around the world to publish, preserve, cite, and reuse research data across disciplines.

The session will begin with an overview of what research data is, why sharing it matters, and how research data repositories fit into today’s data ecosystem. The presenters will then introduce the Dataverse software platform, highlighting key features such as data citation, metadata, versioning, APIs, and integrations that support reproducible and reusable research.

The webinar will also spotlight the global Dataverse community and the role of the GDCC in coordinating collaboration, governance, and sustainability. Attendees will learn about community working groups, annual Dataverse Community Meetings, and regular community calls—low‑barrier ways for newcomers and experienced users alike to get involved.

This session is designed for:
- Data scientists and analysts
- Researchers and students
- Librarians, data stewards, and repository managers

Anyone interested in open science, open source, and research data infrastructure
Whether you are looking to find and reuse high‑quality research data, share your own datasets, or contribute to an open source global community, this webinar will provide a practical and community‑focused introduction to Dataverse.
